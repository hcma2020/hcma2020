                    The Human-centric multimedia analysis is one of the fundamental problems of multimedia understanding. It is a very challenging problem, 
                    which involves multiple tasks such as face detection and recognition, human body pattern analysis, person re-identification, human action 
                    detection, person tracking, human-object interaction, and so on. Today, multiple multimedia sensing technologies and large-scale computing 
                    infrastructures are producing at a rapid velocity a wide variety of big multi-modality data for human-centric analysis, which provide rich 
                    knowledge to help tackle these challenges. Researchers have strived to push the limits of human-centric multimedia analysis in a wide variety 
                    of applications, such as intelligent surveillance, retailing, fashion design, and services. Therefore, the purpose of this workshop is to: 
                    1) bring together the state of the art research on human-centric multimedia analysis; 
                    2) call for a coordinated effort to understand the opportunities and challenges emerging in human-centric multimedia analysis; 
                    3) identify key tasks and evaluate the state-of-the-art methods; 
                    4) showcase innovative methodologies and ideas; 
                    5) introduce interesting real-world human-centric multimedia analysis systems or applications; and 
                    6) propose new real-world datasets and discuss future directions. We solicit original contributions in all fields of human-centric multimedia analysis 
                    that explore the multi-modality data to help us understand the heavier of humans and promote the multimodal human-machine interaction. 
                    We believe the workshop will offer a timely collection of research updates to benefit the researchers and practitioners working in the broad multimedia communities. 
                    To this end, we solicit original research and survey papers in (but not limited to) the following topics:
