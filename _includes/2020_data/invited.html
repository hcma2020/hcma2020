Received her PhD from the University of Leeds, UK (2009). Dima is currently an EPSRC Fellow (2020-2025), focusing on her research interests in the automatic understanding of object interactions, actions and activities using static and wearable visual (and depth) sensors. Dima is a program chair for ICCV 2021 in Montreal, associate editor of IJCV (2020-), IEEE TPAMI (2019-) and Pattern Recognition (2017-). She was selected as a Nokia Research collaborator in 2016, and as an Outstanding Reviewer in CVPR2020, ICCV17, CVPR13 and CVPR12. She currently supervises 5 PhD students, and 4 postdoctoral researchers.</p>

Her research in human-computer interaction explores how humans&#8217; interaction with technology varies depending on their cultural, geographic, and demographic background. To find out about these differences, she conducts large-scale online studies with our virtual lab LabintheWild. LabintheWild is an experiment platform for conducting behavioral studies that lets participants compare themselves to others in exchange for study participation. Using the data from our LabintheWild experiments, her research group builds systems that are able to adapt to these differences and that are more aesthetically appealing, more intuitive, and more usable for specific user groups.</p>
